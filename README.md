# Cat-A-Pum 

**A simple game for no-gamers**
You are a home cat , and, since your humans are out, you can have some fun!
Run around eating all the treats you can, but be careful not to step in one of your many arch-enemys' " droppings". 
In level 2, you get to confront them, armed with your fur balls to get rid of them!

### Game controls

**Space Bar** Jump to catch treats and avoid obstacles
**Rigth-Arrow >** Spit fur balls to eliminate dogs



### Game rules

* Eat treats to uplevel: each eated treat adds 1 to score. Pass level at 10 points.
* Avoid stepping on poop: each touch will subtract 5 from score.
* Shoot fur balls to eliminate enemies. You have to hit 5 times, and each hit will cost you 1 point.
* Game ends when losing all points, or getting cought by an enemy.



## Building the game

This is the first time I was faced with this challenge, and it was quite a ride!



### Technical Challenges

Even when it's a really simple game, I faced some difficulties:
* Working with canvas for the first time, getting to know how it works.
* Structuring the game
* Adding keyboard controls.
* Using setTimeout().



### Biggest mistake

**NOT** starting to work with an structured plan to guide me through development. 

It's noticeable that I've worked adding to what it was already built, not following a clean plan. This led me to struggle with understanding where bugs were, and how to fix them.



### Lessons learned

* **Always** have a plan! 
* Procrastination is your enemy.
* I got a sense of how much I have learned in this two weeks.
